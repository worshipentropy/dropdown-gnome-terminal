# dropdown-gnome-terminal

This script is meant to replace the functionality provided by Guake and other dropdown terminal emulators.

Requires xdotools package

This was developed for use in a Fedora 28 Cinnamon environment.
I suggest mapping the script to a keyboard shortcut using the Gnome Keyboard Shortcuts utility.
